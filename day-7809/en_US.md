## Tech Recruiting

I've been exploring the idea of a tech recruiting agency that sources
from China and get's them in positions at venture funded US startups.

It sounds like a pretty cool idea, speaking with a friend of a friend
soon to explore what such a company would look like. If it goes well,
I'll start to speak to more people in my network about it.

## On Sales

A recruiter told me yesterday that I'm not a salesperson. He told me I
should apply for PM positions instead. I don't know if that's an insult,
but I'm sure he means well!

## College

Seriously considering attending Tsinghua for undergrad soon, probably
means a lot of Chinese cramming, learning all the charecters, etc. Means
learning Chinese is suddenly is a huge priority for me.
