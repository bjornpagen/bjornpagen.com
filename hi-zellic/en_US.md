marcan of the [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/about/) team spent a lot of time on m1n1, his own Apple Silicon
bootloader, before even touching Linux. He got a working Python interpreter over UART so he could read and write 
arbitary bytes to memory. He even added functionality to chainload macOS in a hypervisor, so that he
could trace memory accesses and dump them to be analyzed later.

marcan spent a considerable amount of effort investing in good tools first.
These tools continue to pay dividends, allowing the Asahi Linux
reverse engineering effort to proceed extremely quickly. It's played a
core role in getting contributors with *zero* reversing experience
contributing kernel patches to Asahi.

In the same vein, there's no use hiring any salespeople at Zellic until
you first have efficient [sales automation](https://bjorn.llc) in place.
It's going to be my job to setup all these tools first,
allowing myself and the rest of the sales team to work at optimal capacity.

As an early sales hire, here's my gameplan for Zellic---

1. I'll customize whatever CRM you're currently using and organize/customize it.
   Have you ever used a CRM thinking "I wish we could track XYZ"?
   This involves writing a bunch of API hooks that customize
   the CRM and make it more suitable for selling smart contract
   auditing services.

   Here's an example: at Magna we found that we used Telegram *a lot*
   in communicating with prospects and clients. So, before Barracuda CRM came
   along, I basically implemented Telegram history and followups into our existing Hubspot and
   Notion databases, using the Telegram and Slack APIs.

2. I'll put a focus on total automation (I'm a huge fan of Airtable).
   The more the *sales system* does, the less individuals salespeople
   have to do, and the more time they
   can spend on what they do best---hopping on calls and selling.

   This means---no logging activity, no prospecting, no cold dialing. Contact logging
   should be done automatically by the CRM, and in case it can't be, we'll
   integrate it (ie. Telegram). Prospecting
   should be done by code and automated systems, with ability to add
   any one-off leads that come up. Cold calling (if used) should be done
   by autodialers, and passed off to the salesperson when someone picks up.

3. Like an email expert once told me, I'll *treat leads like a mailing list*.
   In the same way eCommerce brands continually send marketing emails,
   B2B companies can benefit from keeping in contant touch with all of
   their past and current customers.

   In addition to a list of all your current and past clients,
   I'll throw in a list of 6k+ crypto founders
   (which I scraped for Magna). I'll deploy super-targeted
   campaigns to convert them to calls, sending human-personalized emails
   when applicable. Then, I'll take the calls, and prioritize building
   a profitable relationship that keeps them coming back to Zellic.

Just these three things alone should set Zellic up for success. With an
in-demand product and a stellar reputation, all that's keeping you guys
from the big billions is a proper automated outreach system.
