      <p>This is the first post in a series of many.</p>
<p>In a long journey to create the best blog the world has ever seen,
I have attempted to use a lot of different software. Astro, Hugo,
raw static sites&hellip; However, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that it&rsquo;s
best to use a static site generator, but not one that&rsquo;s already done
(ie: Hugo). I needed to write my own.</p>
<h2 id="why-start-from-scratch">Why Start from Scratch?</h2>
<p>Many years ago, I made a blog using Hugo. I remember it being
extremely difficult to deal with the configuration and to
modify the output to my liking. Also, if I wanted to do cool
graph stuff with my blog or notebook (like a knowledge tree),
there is no trivial way to get this working with something
that I haven&rsquo;t written myself.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>When I login to my computer, I see a terminal. I like to edit
files directly from CLI: I&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s the only way to
decrease the resistance enough for me to actually write anything.</p>
<p>To make it as easy as possible to write, I use helix editor in
my terminal emulator, with all of my notes as individual markdown
files inside a git repo. There was no way I was going to maintain
a blog that I have to write in HTML, and no way that I was going
to be satisfied with the CSS output of blog generators like Hugo.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to do <em>any</em> extra configuration with my raw <code>.md</code>
files to make them special. So, I needed to write my own markdown
generator that injected the special details that it needs.</p>
