      <p>marcan of the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/about/">Asahi Linux</a> team spent a lot of time on m1n1, his own Apple Silicon
bootloader, before even touching Linux. He got a working Python interpreter over UART so he could read and write
arbitary bytes to memory. He even added functionality to chainload macOS in a hypervisor, so that he
could trace memory accesses and dump them to be analyzed later.</p>
<p>marcan spent a considerable amount of effort investing in good tools first.
These tools continue to pay dividends, allowing the Asahi Linux
reverse engineering effort to proceed extremely quickly. Its played a
core role in getting contributors with <em>zero</em> reversing experience
contributing kernel patches to Asahi.</p>
<p>In the same vein, there&rsquo;s no use hiring any salespeople at Zellic until
you first have efficient <a href="https://bjorn.llc">sales automation</a> in place.
It&rsquo;s going to be my job to setup all these tools first,
allowing myself and the rest of the sales team to work at optimal capacity.</p>
<p>As an early sales hire, here&rsquo;s my gameplan for Zellic&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll customize whatever CRM you&rsquo;re currently using and organize/customize it.
Have you ever used a CRM thinking &ldquo;I wish we could track XYZ&rdquo;?
This involves writing a bunch of API hooks that customize
the CRM and make it more suitable for selling smart contract
auditing services.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: at Magna we found that we used Telegram <em>a lot</em>
in communicating with prospects and clients. So, before Barracuda CRM came
along, I basically implemented Telegram history and followups into our existing Hubspot and
Notion databases, using the Telegram and Slack APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a focus on total automation (I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Airtable).
The more the <em>sales system</em> does, the less individuals salespeople
have to do, and the more time they
can spend on what they do best&mdash;hopping on calls and selling.</p>
<p>This means&mdash;no logging activity, no prospecting, no cold dialing. Contact logging
should be done automatically by the CRM, and in case it can&rsquo;t be, we&rsquo;ll
integrate it (ie. Telegram). Prospecting
should be done by code and automated systems, with ability to add
any one-off leads that come up. Cold calling (if used) should be done
by autodialers, and passed off to the salesperson when someone picks up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like an email expert once told me, I&rsquo;ll <em>treat leads like a mailing list</em>.
In the same way eCommerce brands continually send marketing emails,
B2B companies can benefit from keeping in contant touch with all of
their past and current customers.</p>
<p>In addition to a list of all your current and past clients,
I&rsquo;ll throw in a list of 6k+ crypto founders
(which I scraped for Magna). I&rsquo;ll deploy super-targeted
campaigns to convert them to calls, sending human-personalized emails
when applicable. Then, I&rsquo;ll take the calls, and prioritize building
a profitable relationship that keeps them coming back to Zellic.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just these three things alone should set Zellic up for success. With an
in-demand product and a stellar reputation, all that&rsquo;s keeping you guys
from the big billions is a proper automated outreach system.</p>
