      <p>marcan of the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/about/">Asahi Linux</a> team spent months perfecting m1n1, his own Apple Silicon
bootloader, before even touching Linux. He even added functionality to chainload macOS in a hypervisor, so that he
could trace reads and writes to memory and dump them to be analyzed later.</p>
<p>These initial investments in infrastructure continue to pay divideds to the Asahi Linux team, allowing the Asahi Linux
reverse engineering effort to proceed at impressive speed.</p>
<p>In the same vein, there&rsquo;s no use hiring any salespeople at Zellic until
you first have efficient <a href="https://bjorn.llc">sales automation</a> in place.</p>
<p>As your first sales hire, here&rsquo;s my gameplan for Zellic&mdash;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have you ever used a CRM thinking &ldquo;I wish we could track XYZ&rdquo;?
I&rsquo;ll customize whatever CRM you&rsquo;re currently using and make it scalable
for future sales hires. This involves writing a bunch of API hooks that customize
the CRM and make it more suitable for selling smart contract
auditing services, to make the job easier for future salespeople.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: at Magna we found that we used Telegram <em>a lot</em>
in communicating with prospects and clients. So, before baracuda came
along, I basically implemented baracuda using our existing Hubspot and
Notion databases, using the Telegram and Slack APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same way you continually send marketing emails as an eCommerce brand,
B2B companies can benefit from keeping in contant touch with all of
their past and current customers. This makes up a huge portion of your
unrealized income.</p>
<p>In addition to a list of all your current and past clients,
I&rsquo;ll throw in a list of 1.7k crypto founders
(which I scraped for Magna). I&rsquo;ll setup a mass email marketing
campaign to convert them to
calls. Then, I&rsquo;ll take the calls, and provide as much value
to them as I can to them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put a focus on total automation (I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Airtable).
The more the <em>sales system</em> does, the less individuals salespeople
have to do, and the more time they
can spend on what they do best&mdash;hopping on calls and selling.</p>
<p>This means&mdash;no logging activity, no prospecting. Contact logging
should be done automatically by the CRM, and in case it can&rsquo;t be, we&rsquo;ll
integrate it (ie. Telegram). Prospecting
should be done by code and automated systems, with ability to add
any one-off leads that come up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just these three things alone should set Zellic up for success. With an
in-demand product and a stellar reputation, all that&rsquo;s keeping you guys
from the big billions is a proper automated outreach system.</p>
