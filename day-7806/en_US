Today is a bipolar sunny/rainy day in Shanghai.
Plan is to stay indoors and work:

## TODO

- Get [bjorn.llc](https://bjorn.llc) setup on Google Ads.
- Import all my old `todo` notebook into
  [bjornpagen.com](https://bjornpagen.com).
- Figure out some way to do inline encryption so I can
  hide stuff I don't want on the open internet. Better
  to keep all my writing in one repo, since context
  switching is bad.
