Today is a bipolar sunny/rainy day in Shanghai.
Plan is to stay indoors and work:

## TODO

- ~~Get [bjorn.llc](https://bjorn.llc) setup on Google Ads.~~
  - Now we just have to wait for the ads to get approved.
- ~~Setup analytics for [bjornpagen.com](https://bjornpagen.com)~~
- ~~Figure out some way to do inline encryption. I can hide stuff
    I don't want on the open internet. Better to keep all my
    writing in one repo, since context switching is bad.~~
  - I ended up embedding a PGP message in a code block,
    using CSS to hide it. What's cool is that I can use
    my editor's *pipe* functionality to create it directly
    when I'm writing a document.
- Setup outbound Cold Email funnel to get more leads for
  (bjorn.llc)[https://bjorn.llc]. I imagine this involves an
  instantly campaign with automated scraping of marketing
  agencies. We'll probably focus on an eCommerce niche.

## Reminders

- One day we have to turn off this annoying ACPI power button.
  On Arch, and by extension Asahi, accidentially pressing it
  will immediately shutdown the system.

This post contains an *encrypted* message.

Yesterday I wrote [[hello world]] but I had to recommit
the article today, so that's why it says it was created
today.
